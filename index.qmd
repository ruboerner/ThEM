## Prerequisites {.unnumbered}

These are the lecture notes for the 2024 module on **Theory of Electromagnetic Methods** for students of Geophysics in the Masters course at the [Institute of Geophysics and Geoinformatics, TU Bergakademie Freiberg](https://tu-freiberg.de/geophysik).

All materials are stored in the GitHub repo <https://github.com/ruboerner/ThEM>.

Have fun!

## Background

This lecture is aimed at Master's students in the 2nd semester. It is advisable to know the basics of electromagnetic applications.

Furthermore, successful completion of the course on Theoretical Physics - Electrodynamics - is a highly recommended prerequisite for this lecture.

## Code

This course material contains lots of Python code immersed in the sections.

You can always copy the code and run it in a suitable Python runtime environment.

It is recommended to the Python installer which comes with [_miniconda_](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html).

Further, you can develop own ideas and dive deeper into the course material when you create your own _Jupyter notebooks_. To this end, you can use any of

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Jupyterlab](https://jupyter.org)
- [Quarto](https://quarto.org)
- [mystMD](https://mystmd.org).

Working with Jupter Notebooks in Visual Studio Code is [very easy](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).

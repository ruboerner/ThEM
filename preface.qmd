These lecture notes serve as a supplement to the course.

We deal with the following problems:

-   Electromagnetic fields and their mathematical description using Maxwell's equations
-   Partial differential equations and their solutions
-   Fields of dipole sources in a uniform fullspace
-   Dipole induction over a stratified halfspace
-   Time-domain EM
-   Numerical evaluation of Hankel integrals
-   Outlook on numerical methods in 2D and 2D

The course deals in particular with all the details that serve to solve the problem of calculating airborne EM fields.

These lecture notes serve as a supplement to the course.

We deal with the following problems:

* Electromagnetic fields and their mathematical description using Maxwell's equations
* Partial differential equations and their solutions
* Fields of dipole sources in a uniform fullspace
* Dipole induction over a stratified halfspace
* Time-domain EM
* Numerical evaluation of Hankel integrals
* Outlook on numerical methods in 2D and 2D

The course deals in particular with all the details that serve to solve the problem of calculating airborne EM fields.

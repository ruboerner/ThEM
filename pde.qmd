As we have seen, Maxwell's equations can be coupled using the constitutive equations and Ohm's law.

After Fourier transform w.r.t. time $t$, but in a slightly different notation, we obtain 
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\nabla \times & -i\omega\varepsilon \mathbf I \\
+i\omega\mu_0 \mathbf I & \nabla \times
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf H \\ \mathbf E
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf J \\ \mathbf 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$ 

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\nabla \cdot & 0 \\
0 & \nabla \cdot
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf B \\ \mathbf D
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\ \rho_E
\end{bmatrix}
$$ 
Note that the sources of the fields--- $\mathbf J$ and $\rho_E$ ---always appear on the right-hand side of the equations. $\mathbf I$ denotes the 3-by-3 identity matrix.

By elimination of one field, e.g., the magnetic field, we are able to cast the system of first-order ODEs into a *second-order partial differential equation* (PDE).

As an alternative, a complete solution of the Maxwell system, i.e., $\mathbf E$ and $\mathbf H$, can be obtained by taking the solution of one of the two vector valued equations and applying the curl.

We refer to the following *types* of PDEs:

-   elliptic
-   parabolic
-   hyperbolic

-   What are the characteristic features of the three types of PDEs?
-   What typical (geophysical) applications are associated with the above types?

## The curl-curl equation

We first eliminate one field from the set of Maxwell's equations by applying the *curl operator* ($\nabla \times$) to one of the equations.

This results in a second-order PDE because we differentiate twice with respect to spatial coordinates.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
$$
\begin{align}
\nabla \times \mathbf e  & = -\partial_t \mathbf b \\
\nabla \times \nabla \times \mathbf e & = \nabla \times (-\partial_t \mathbf b) \\
  & = -\nabla \times (\partial_t \mathbf b) \\
  & = -\partial_t\nabla \times  \mathbf b \\
  & = -\partial_t\nabla \times ( \mu \mathbf h) \\
  & = -\partial_t \mu \nabla \times \mathbf h \\
  & = -\mu \partial_t \nabla \times \mathbf h \\
  & = -\mu \partial_t (\mathbf j + \partial_t \mathbf d) \\
  & = -\mu \partial_t (\sigma \mathbf e + \partial_t \mathbf d) \\
  & -\mu \partial_t (\sigma \mathbf e + \partial_t \varepsilon \mathbf e) \\
  & = -\mu \partial_t \sigma \mathbf e -\mu \partial^2_{tt} \varepsilon \mathbf e \\
  & = -\mu \sigma \partial_t \mathbf e -\mu \varepsilon \partial^2_{tt} \mathbf e
\end{align}
$$

Finally, we obtain the **curl-curl equation** for the electric field as
$$
\nabla \times \nabla \times \mathbf e  +\mu \sigma \partial_t \mathbf e + \mu \varepsilon \partial^2_{tt} \mathbf e = \mathbf 0.
$$ {#eq-curlcurl}

This is a second-order PDE with first- and second-order time derivatives.

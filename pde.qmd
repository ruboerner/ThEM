As we have seen, Maxwell's equations can be coupled using the constitutive equations and Ohm's law.

After Fourier transform w.r.t. time $t$, but in a slightly different notation, we obtain $$
\begin{bmatrix}
\nabla \times & -i\omega\varepsilon \mathbf I \\
+i\omega\mu_0 \mathbf I & \nabla \times
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf H \\ \mathbf E
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf J \\ \mathbf 0
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
\begin{bmatrix}
\nabla \cdot & 0 \\
0 & \nabla \cdot
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf B \\ \mathbf D
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0 \\ \rho_E
\end{bmatrix}
$$ Note that the sources of the fields--- $\mathbf J$ and $\rho_E$ ---always appear on the right-hand side of the equations. $\mathbf I$ denotes the 3-by-3 identity matrix.

By elimination of one field, e.g., the magnetic field, we are able to cast the system of first-order ODEs into a *second-order partial differential equation* (PDE).

As an alternative, a complete solution of the Maxwell system, i.e., $\mathbf E$ and $\mathbf H$, can be obtained by taking the solution of one of the two vector valued equations and applying the curl.

We refer to the following *types* of PDEs:

-   elliptic
-   parabolic
-   hyperbolic

## The curl-curl equation

We first eliminate one field from the set of Maxwell's equations by applying the *curl operator* ($\nabla \times$) to one of the equations, i.e., Faraday's law.

This results in a second-order PDE because we differentiate twice with respect to spatial coordinates.

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
$$
\begin{align}
\nabla \times \mathbf e  & = -\partial_t \mathbf b \\
\nabla \times \nabla \times \mathbf e & = \nabla \times (-\partial_t \mathbf b) \\
  & = -\nabla \times (\partial_t \mathbf b) \\
  & = -\partial_t\nabla \times  \mathbf b \\
  & = -\partial_t\nabla \times ( \mu \mathbf h) \\
  & = -\partial_t \mu \nabla \times \mathbf h \\
  & = -\mu \partial_t \nabla \times \mathbf h \\
  & = -\mu \partial_t (\mathbf j + \partial_t \mathbf d) \\
  & = -\mu \partial_t (\sigma \mathbf e + \partial_t \mathbf d) \\
  & -\mu \partial_t (\sigma \mathbf e + \partial_t \varepsilon \mathbf e) \\
  & = -\mu \partial_t \sigma \mathbf e -\mu \partial^2_{tt} \varepsilon \mathbf e \\
  & = -\mu \sigma \partial_t \mathbf e -\mu \varepsilon \partial^2_{tt} \mathbf e
\end{align}
$$
:::

Finally, we obtain the **curl-curl equation** for the electric field $\mathbf e$ as $$
\nabla \times \nabla \times \mathbf e  +\mu \sigma \partial_t \mathbf e + \mu \varepsilon \partial^2_{tt} \mathbf e = \mathbf 0.
$$ {#eq-curlcurl}

This is a second-order PDE with first- and second-order time derivatives.

Note that you obtain a similar PDE for the magnetic field $\mathbf h$ if you apply the steps outlined above to Ampere's law.

Often, a slightly different form of @eq-curlcurl is used.

The following identity is useful for any vector field $\mathbf f$: $$
\nabla \times \nabla \times \mathbf f = \nabla \nabla \cdot \mathbf f - \nabla^2 \mathbf f 
$$ {#eq-vector-identity}

This equation is useful, e.g., when $\nabla \cdot \mathbf f = 0$. In this case the curl-curl operator can be replaced by $-\nabla^2$, the *vector Laplace operator* defined over a vector field.

::: callout-warning
The vector Laplacian is similar to the scalar Laplacian. The scalar Laplacian applies to a scalar field and returns a scalar quantity, whereas the vector Laplacian applies to a vector field and returns a vector quantity.

In Cartesian coordinates, the returned vector field is equal to the vector field of the scalar Laplacian applied to each vector component.

Under which conditions can we switch from the *curl-curl* to the *Laplace* operator? Clearly, the term $\nabla \nabla \cdot \mathbf f$ must vanish (or its contribution must be negligible).

### Decay of free charges

When the electric field $\mathbf e$ is considered, we are faced with the following problem: Under which conditions $\nabla \cdot \mathbf e$ becomes negligible small?

The answer should be clear: When there are no free charges present in the considered domain, there is no associated electric field.

Recall, that in a uniform dielectric medium there holds *GauÃŸ' s law* for electric charges

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf e = \frac{\rho_E}{\varepsilon},
$$

where $\rho_E$ is the volume charge density and $\varepsilon = \varepsilon_r \varepsilon_0$ is the permittivity.

Let's find out how to solve the problem.

We want to show that $\nabla \cdot \mathbf e \approx 0$ for some time $t>0$. As long as $t \le 0$, there is a certain charge density $\rho_E(t)$ concentrated at, e.g., the origin of a uniform fullspace.

We apply the divergence operator to Ampere's law:

$$
\begin{align}
\nabla \cdot \nabla \times \mathbf h & = \nabla \cdot \mathbf j + \partial_t \nabla \cdot \mathbf d \\
& = 0
\end{align}
$$

With $$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf d = \rho_E \\
\nabla \cdot \mathbf j = \nabla \cdot (\sigma \mathbf e) = \nabla\sigma \cdot \mathbf e + \sigma \nabla \cdot \mathbf e \\
\sigma \nabla \cdot \mathbf e = \sigma \frac{\rho_E}{\varepsilon}
$$ we obtain an initial-value problem for the charge density

$$
\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon} \rho_E + \dot{\rho_E} = 0.
$$

Its solution is

$$
\rho_E(t) = \rho_E(0) \exp\left({-\frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon}t}\right).
$$ {#eq-decay}

#### Numerical experiment

To study the decay of a free charge denoted by an electrical charge density, we define as initial condition for $t=0$ that $\rho_E(0) = 1~A\cdot s\cdot m^{-3}$ .

Further, the conductivity of the uniform fullspace is 0.01 S/m.

We plot the function @eq-decay for a very small time window:

```{python}
#| code-fold: true
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

sigma_n = 0.01
epsilon_n = 8.854e-12

def rho(t):
  return np.exp(-sigma_n/epsilon_n * t)

t_n = np.logspace(-13, -7, num=71, endpoint=True)

plt.semilogx(t_n, rho(t_n))
plt.xlabel('t in s')
plt.ylabel(r'$\rho_E(t)/\rho_E(0)$')
plt.show()
```

By visual inspection, after approx. 10 ns the volume charge density has dropped to zero.

Let's be more precise:

We can calculate the time at which the charge density decays to a given fraction of its initial value, e.g., to 1 ppm.

```{python}
from sympy import *

t, sigma, epsilon, rho0 = symbols('t sigma epsilon rho_0', real=True)
rhoE = symbols('rho_E')

expr = rhoE - rho0 * exp(-sigma / epsilon * t)

tt = solve(expr, t)
tt[0]
```

We find that the time $t$ at which a certain fraction of the initial charge density is obtained, can be calculated using

$$
\hat{t} = \frac{\epsilon }{\sigma}\log{\left(\frac{\rho_{0}}{\rho_{E}} \right)} = -\frac{\epsilon }{\sigma}\log{\left(\frac{\rho_{E}}{\rho_{0}} \right)}
$$

```{python}
tstar = -epsilon_n / sigma_n * np.log(1e-6)
```

With the values given above, the charge density drops to 1 ppm of its initial value after `{python} '{0:.2e}'.format(tstar)` seconds.

## The Telegraph equation

By virtue of @eq-vector-identity we can cast the curl-curl equation @eq-curlcurl into the telegraph equation of induction, such that

$$
-\nabla^2 \mathbf e + \mu \sigma \partial_t \mathbf e + \mu \varepsilon \partial^2_{tt} \mathbf e = \mathbf 0.
$$ {#eq-telegraph-full}

::: callout-note
Note that the same PDE can be derived for the magnetic field!
:::

Eq. @eq-telegraph-full and @eq-curlcurl are second-order linear PDEs with at most second-order time derivatives. Hence, they describe wave phenomena.

::: callout-note
A second-order, linear, constant-coefficient PDE for $u$ takes the general form

$$
A u_{xx} + 2 B u_{xy} + C u_{yy} + D u_x + E u_y + F u + G = 0
$$

This PDE is classified as being

-   *parabolic,* when $B^2 - AC = 0$

-   *hyperbolic*, when $B^2 - AC > 0$

-   *elliptic*, when $B^2 - AC < 0$.

In our case, $x$ plays the role of any spatial variable, and $t$ plays the role of $y$.

Hence, for @eq-telegraph-full, $A=-1$, $E=\mu\sigma$, $C=\mu\varepsilon$, and the remaining coefficients are zero.

Checks:

$B^2 - AC = 0 - (-1 \cdot \mu\varepsilon) > 0$ $\to$ PDE is *hyperbolic*.

$B^2 - AC = 0 - (-1 \cdot 0) = 0$ $\to$ PDE is *parabolic*

For the elliptic PDE there are no time derivatives, we can therefore let $x$ and $y$ take their roles as Cartesian coordinates.

So, with $A = C = -1$,

$B^2 - AC = 0 - (-1 \cdot -1) < 0$ $\to$ PDE is elliptic.

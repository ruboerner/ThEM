  abstract = {The usefulness of the electrical resistivity log in determining reservoircharacteristics is governed largely by:the accuracy with which the trueresistivity of the formation can be determined;the scope of detailed dataconcerning the relation of resistivity measurements to formationcharacteristics;the available information concerning the conductivity ofconnate or formation waters;the extent of geologic knowledge regardingprobable changes in facies within given horizons, both vertically andlaterally, particularly in relation to the resultant effect on the electricalproperties of the reservoir.             Simple examples are given in the following pagesto illustrate the use of resistivity logs in the solution of some problemsdealing with oil and gas reservoirs. From the available information, it isapparent that much care must be exercised in applying to more complicated casesthe methods suggested. It should be remembered that the equations given are notprecise and represent only approximate relationships. It is believed, however, that under favorable conditions their application falls within useful limits ofaccuracy.                            Introduction               The electrical log has been used extensively in a qualitative way tocorrelate formations penetrated by the drill in the exploitation of oil and gasreservoirs and to provide some indication of reservoir content. However, itsuse in a quantitative way has been limited because of various factors that tendto obscure the significance of the electrical readings obtained. Some of thesefactors are the borehole size, the resistivity of the mud in the borehole, theeffect of invasion of the mud filtrate into the formation, the relation of therecorded thickness of beds to electrode spacing, the heterogeneity of geologicformations, the salinity or conductivity of connate water, and, perhaps ofgreatest importance, the lack of data indicating the relationship of theresistivity of a formation in situ to its character and fluid content.               On the Gulf Coast it is found that the effects of the size of the boreholeand the mud resistivity are generally of little importance, except when dealingwith high formational resistivities or extremely low mud resistivities.Fortunately, little practical significance need be attached to the exact valuesof the higher resistivities recorded. Low mud resistivities are not common, butwhen this condition is encountered it may be corrected by replacing the mudcolumn. With the present advanced knowledge of mud control, invasion of mudfiltrate into sands can be minimized, thereby increasing the dependability ofthe electrical log. The effect of electrode spacing on the recorded thicknessof a bed is often subject to compensation or can be sufficiently accounted forto provide an acceptable approximation of the true resistivity of theformation.

The moment magnitude (Mw) 7.8 mainshock ruptured a 310 km-long segment of the left-lateral East Anatolian Fault, propagating through multiple releasing step-overs. The Mw 7.6 aftershock involved nearby left-lateral strike-slip faults of the East Anatolian Fault Zone, causing a 150 km-long rupture. We use remote-sensing observations to constrain the spatial distribution of coseismic slip for these two events and the February 20 Mw 6.4 aftershock near Antakya. Pixel tracking of optical and synthetic aperture radar data of the Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellites, respectively, provide near-field surface displacements. High-rate Global Navigation Satellite System data constrain each event separately. Coseismic slip extends from the surface to about 15 km depth with a shallow slip deficit. Most aftershocks cluster at major fault bends, surround the regions of high coseismic slip, or extend outward of the ruptured faults. For the mainshock, rupture propagation stopped southward at the diffuse termination of the East Anatolian fault and tapered off northward into the P\"ut\"urge segment, some 20 km south of the 2020 Mw 6.8 Elazi\u{g} earthquake, highlighting a potential seismic gap. These events underscore the high seismic potential of immature fault systems.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Bayesian inversion of electromagnetic data produces crucial uncertainty information on inferred subsurface resistivity. Due to their high computational cost, however, Bayesian inverse methods have largely been restricted to computationally expedient 1-D resistivity models. In this study, we successfully demonstrate, for the first time, a fully 2-D, trans-dimensional Bayesian inversion of magnetotelluric (MT) data. We render this problem tractable from a computational standpoint by using a stochastic interpolation algorithm known as a Gaussian process (GP) to achieve a parsimonious parametrization of the model vis-a-vis the dense parameter grids used in numerical forward modelling codes. The GP links a trans-dimensional, parallel tempered Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, which explores the parsimonious model space, to MARE2DEM, an adaptive finite element forward solver. MARE2DEM computes the model response using a dense parameter mesh with resistivity assigned via the GP model. We demonstrate the new trans-dimensional GP sampler by inverting both synthetic and field MT data for 2-D models of electrical resistivity, with the field data example converging within 10~d on 148 cores, a non-negligible but tractable computational cost. For a field data inversion, our algorithm achieves a parameter reduction of over 32\texttimes{} compared to the fixed parameter grid used for the MARE2DEM regularized inversion. Resistivity probability distributions computed from the ensemble of models produced by the inversion yield credible intervals and interquartile plots that quantitatively show the non-linear 2-D uncertainty in model structure. This uncertainty could then be propagated to other physical properties that impact resistivity including bulk composition, porosity and pore-fluid content.},

  abstract = {In many cases, inversion in 2D gives a better description of the subsurface compared with 1D inversion, but, computationally, 2D inversion is expensive, and it can be hard to use for large-scale surveys. We have developed an efficient hybrid 2D airborne frequency-domain electromagnetic inversion algorithm. Our hybrid scheme combines 1D and 2D inversions in a three-stage process, in which each step is progressively more accurate and computationally more expensive than the previous one. This results in an approximately [Formula: see text] speedup compared with full 2D inversions, and with only minor changes to the inversion results. Our inversion structure is based on a regular grid, in which each sounding is discretized individually. The 1D modeling code uses layered models with derivatives derived through the finite-difference method, whereas our 2D modeling code uses an adaptive finite-element mesh, and it uses the adjoint-state method to calculate the derivatives. By incorporating the inversion grid structure into the 2D finite-element mesh, interpolation between the different meshes becomes trivial. Large surveys are handled by using local meshing to split large surveys into small sections, which retains the 2D information. The algorithm is heavily optimized and parallelized over the frequencies and sections, with good scalability even on nonuniform memory architecture systems, on which it is generally hard to achieve a satisfactory scaling. The algorithm has been tested successfully with various synthetic studies as well as field examples, of which results from two synthetic studies and a field example are shown.},

Distributions for other elastic parameters can also be assessed\textemdash for example, acoustic impedance, shear impedance, and P-wave to S-wave velocity ratio. The inversion algorithm is based on the convolutional model and a linearized weak contrast approximation of the Zoeppritz equation. The solution is represented by a Gaussian posterior distribution with explicit expressions for the posterior expectation and covariance; hence, exact prediction intervals for the inverted parameters can be computed under the specified model. The explicit analytical form of the posterior distribution provides a computationally fast inversion method. Tests on synthetic data show that all inverted parameters were almost perfectly retrieved when the noise approached zero. With realistic noise levels, acoustic impedance was the best determined parameter, while the inversion provided practically no information about the density. The inversion algorithm has also been tested on a real 3-D data set from the Sleipner field. The results show good agreement with well logs, but the uncertainty is high.},

  abstract = {Machine learning, and specifically deep-learning (DL) techniques applied to geophysical inverse problems, is an attractive subject, which has promising potential and, at the same time, presents some challenges in practical implementation. Some obstacles relate to scarce knowledge of the searched geologic structures, a problem that can limit the interpretability and generalizability of the trained DL networks when applied to independent scenarios in real applications. Commonly used (physics-driven) least-squares optimization methods are very efficient local optimization techniques but require good starting models close to the correct solution to avoid local minima. We have developed a hybrid workflow that combines both approaches in a coupled physics-driven/DL inversion scheme. We exploit the benefits and characteristics of both inversion techniques to converge to solutions that typically outperform individual inversion results and bring the solution closer to the global minimum of a nonconvex inverse problem. The completely data-driven and self-feeding procedure relies on a coupling mechanism between the two inversion schemes taking the form of penalty functions applied to the model term. Predictions from the DL network are used to constrain the least-squares inversion, whereas the feedback loop from inversion to the DL scheme consists of the network retraining with partial results obtained from inversion. The self-feeding process tends to converge to a common agreeable solution, which is the result of two independent schemes with different mathematical formalisms and different objective functions on the data and model misfit. We determine that the hybrid procedure is converging to robust and high-resolution resistivity models when applied to the inversion of the synthetic and field transient electromagnetic data. Finally, we speculate that the procedure may be adopted to recast the way we solve inverse problems in several different disciplines.},

Although seismic, infrasound and hydroacoustic technology is used by the International Monitoring System               4               to monitor nuclear explosions as part of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the detection and location of lower-yield military attacks requires a network of sensors much closer to the source of the explosions. Obtaining comprehensive and objective data that can be used to effectively monitor an active conflict zone therefore remains a substantial challenge. Here we show how seismic waves generated by explosions in northern Ukraine and recorded by a local network of seismometers can be used to automatically identify individual attacks in close to real time, providing an unprecedented view of an active conflict zone. Between February and November 2022, we observed more than 1,200 explosions from the Kyiv, Zhytomyr and Chernihiv provinces, providing accurate origin times, locations and magnitudes. We identify a range of seismoacoustic signals associated with various types of military attack, with the resulting catalogue of explosions far exceeding the number of publicly reported attacks. Our results demonstrate that seismic data can be an effective tool for objective monitoring of a continuing conflict, providing invaluable information about potential breaches of international law.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and seismic imaging have proven to be important tools for the characterization of rock volumes. Both methods provide information about the physical rock mass properties and geological structures away from boreholes or tunnel walls. Here, we present the results from a geophysical characterization campaign that was conducted as part of a decametre-scale hydraulic stimulation experiment in the crystalline rock volume of the Grimsel Test Site (central Switzerland). For this characterization experiment, we used tunnel-based GPR reflection imaging as well as seismic travel-time tomography to investigate the volumes between several tunnels and boreholes. The interpretation of the GPR data with respect to geological structures is based on the unmigrated and migrated images. For the tomographic analysis of the seismic first-arrival travel-time data, we inverted for an anisotropic velocity model described by the Thomsen parameters v0, {$\epsilon$} and {$\delta$} to account for the rock mass foliation. Subsequently, the GPR and seismic images were interpreted in combination with the geological model of the test volume and the known in situ stress states. We found that the ductile~shear zones are clearly imaged by GPR and show an increase in seismic anisotropy due to a stronger foliation, while they are not visible in the p-wave (v0) velocity model. Regions of decreased seismic p-wave velocity, however, correlate with regions of high fracture density. For geophysical characterization of potential deep geothermal reservoirs, our results imply that wireline-compatible borehole GPR should be considered for~shear zone characterization, and that seismic anisotropy and velocity information are desirable to acquire in order to gain information about ductile~shear zones and fracture density, respectively.},

  abstract = {Summary             Airborne systems collecting transient electromagnetic data are able to gather large amounts of data over large areas in a very short time. These data are most often interpreted through 1D inversions, due to the availability of robust, fast and efficient codes. However, in areas where the subsurface contains complex structures or large conductivity contrasts, 1D inversions may introduce artefacts into the models, which may prevent correct interpretation of the results. In these cases, 2D or 3D inversion should be used. Here we present a 2.5D inversion code using 3D forward modeling combined with a 2D model grid. A 2.5D inversion is useful where the flight-lines are spaced far apart, in which case a 3D inversion would not add value in relation to the added computational cost and complexity. By exploiting the symmetry of the transmitter and receiver system we are able to perform forward calculations on a reduced 3D mesh using only half the domain transecting the centre of the transmitter and receiver system. The forward responses and sensitivities from the reduced 3D mesh are projected onto a structured 2D model grid following the flight direction. The difference in forward calculations are within 1.4 per cent using the reduced mesh compared to a full 3D solution. The inversion code is tested on a synthetic example constructed with complex geology and high conductivity contrasts and the results are compared to a 1D inversion. We find that the 2.5D inversion recovers both the conductivity values and shape of the true model with a significantly higher accuracy than the 1D inversion. Finally, the results are supported by a field case using airborne TEM data from the island of Mayotte. The inverted flight-line consisted of 418 soundings, and the inversion spent an average of 6750~s per iteration, converging in 16 iterations with a peak memory usage of 97 GB, using 18 logical processors. In general, the total time of the 2D inversions compared to a full 3D inversion are reduced by a factor of 2.5 while the memory consumption was reduced by a factor of 2, reflecting the half-mesh approach.},

  abstract = {The McMurdo Dry Valleys are a polar desert in coastal Antarctica, where glaciers, permafrost, ice-covered lakes, and ephemeral summer streams coexist. Liquid water is found at the surface only in lakes and in the temporary streams that feed them. Past geophysical exploration has yielded ambiguous results regarding the presence of subsurface water. In 2011, we used a helicopter-borne, time-domain electromagnetic (TDEM) sensor to map resistivity in the subsurface across the Dry Valleys. The airborne electromagnetic (AEM) method excels at finding subsurface liquid water in polar deserts, where water remains liquid under cold conditions if it is sufficiently saline, and therefore electrically conductive. Over the course of 26~h of helicopter time, we covered large portions of the Dry Valleys and vastly increased our geophysical understanding of the subsurface, particularly with respect to water. Our data show extensive subsurface low-resistivity layers approximately 150\textendash 250~m below the surface and beneath higher resistivity layers. We interpret the low-resistivity layers as geologic materials containing freeze-concentrated or ``cryoconcentrated'' hyper saline brines lying beneath glaciers and frozen permafrost. These brines appeared to be contiguous with surface lakes, subglacial regions, and the Ross Sea, which could indicate a regional-hydrogeologic system, wherein solutes might be transported between surface reservoirs by ionic diffusion and subsurface flow. The presence of such brines underneath glaciers might have implications for glacier movement. Systems such as this, where brines exist beneath glacial ice and frozen permafrost, may exist elsewhere in coastal Antarctica; AEM resistivity is an ideal tool to find and survey them. Our application of TDEM demonstrates that in polar subsurface environments containing conductive brines, such a diffusive electromagnetic method is superior to radar surveying in terms of depth of penetration and ability to differentiate hydrogeologic conditions.},

  abstract = {Fire is an important ecosystem process and has played a complex role in terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere environment. Sometimes, wildfires are highly destructive natural disasters. To reduce their destructive impact, wildfires must be detected as soon as possible. However, accurate and timely monitoring of wildfires is a challenging task due to the traditional threshold methods easily be suffered to the false alarms caused by small forest clearings, and the omission error of large fires obscured by thick smoke. Deep learning has the characteristics of strong learning ability, strong adaptability and good portability. At present, few studies have addressed the wildfires detection problem in remote sensing images using deep learning method in a nearly real time way. Therefore, in this research we proposed an active fire detection system using a novel convolutional neural network (FireCNN). FireCNN uses multi-scale convolution and residual acceptance design, which can effectively extract the accurate characteristics of fire spots. The proposed method was tested on dataset which contained 1,823 fire spots and 3,646 non-fire spots. The experimental results demonstrate that the FireCNN is fully capable of wildfire detection, with the accuracy of 35.2\% higher than the traditional threshold method. We also examined the influence of different structural designs on the performance of neural network models. The comparison results indicates the proposed method produced the best results.},

  abstract = {Many computing schemes have been devised for determining the gravity anomalies produced by two-dimensional masses. Most of these are based upon the evaluation of an areal integral and require specially constructed templates or tables. In the present paper it is shown that the gravity anomaly {$\Delta$}g at the origin of coordinates, produced by a two-dimensional mass of constant density contrast {$\Delta\rho$}, may be obtained quite simply by means of either of the line integrals [Formula: see text] where z is the vertical coordinate, and \texttheta{} the polar coordinate expressed in radians of a point on the periphery of the mass in a plane normal to its axis and passing through the origin. The line integrals are evaluated around the periphery of the mass and are of opposite sign if taken in the same direction of traverse, or are of the same sign if taken in opposite directions. For use of these integrals no special equipment is required other than a simple template consisting of radial lines, \texttheta =const., and horizontal lines, z=const., which can be constructed in a few minutes with protractor and scale. This can be constructed either for 1:1 or for an exaggerated vertical-to-horizontal scale.},

The calculations are computed in the frequency domain and then transformed back into the space domain using the inverse Fourier transform. The filter has been tested on magnetic data collected at a test site with UXO bodies of variable orientation. It was also validated on magnetic data measured at a former army artillery range in Slovakia. The results show that the IAS filter not only revealed better imaging of the UXO bodies compared to the other commonly used filters but also produced a high-resolution image with much less influence of noise.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Volcanoes reawakening after long repose must rupture the crust before magma can erupt. Rupture is preceded by repeatable variations in the rate of seismicity with ground movement, which trace the amount of applied stress that is released by local earthquakes. A rupturing sequence has been developing across four episodes of ground uplift at Italy's Campi Flegrei caldera: in 1950-1952, 1969-1972, 1982-1984 and since 2004. We predicted in 2016 that the approach to rupture would continue after an additional uplift of 30-40\,cm at the location of largest movement. We have updated our analysis with new data on changes in the numbers of local earthquakes with amounts of ground movement. Here we show that subsequent events have confirmed our prediction and that the unrest has been changing the structure of Campi Flegrei's crust. The results provide new constraints for evaluating the volcano's potential to erupt or to subside without eruption.},

We present a complete overview of how such mappings can be performed using scalar magnetometers, including initial sensor testing, time stamping validation, data positioning, noise removal, and source model inversion. A test survey was performed across disarmed UXO targets, during which three scalar magnetometers were towed in an airframe (``bird'') 10 m below a small ({$<$}25 kg) high speed ({$\sim$}10 m/s) UAV to avoid magnetic disturbances from the UAV itself. Data were collected across {$\sim$}58 min of flight, with each sensor traversing {$\sim$}31.7 km to acquire dense data coverage across a 600 m \texttimes{} 100 m area. By using three individual magnetometers in the bird, UXO detection results across single-sensor data and several different multi-sensor configurations can be compared. The data obtained exhibited low apparent noise floors (on the order of tens of picoTesla) and retained a precision that enabled targeted modelling and removal of high-frequency noise with amplitudes of {$\pm$}5 picoTesla. All of the different gradiometer configurations tested enabled recovery of most targets (including all major targets), although the horizontal configuration performed significantly worse in comparison.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             During scalar magnetic surveys, where the amplitude of the magnetic field is measured, small changes in towed sensor positions can produce complex noise-resembling signals in the data. For well-constructed measurement systems, these signals often contain valuable information, rather than noise, but it can difficult to realize their potential. We present a simple, general approach, which can be used to directly invert data from scalar magnetic surveys, regardless of dynamic or unexpected sensor position variations. The approach generalizes classic along-track gradients to an iterative, or recursive, difference, that can be applied irrespective of the amount of magnetic sensors and their positions within a dynamic measurement system, as long as these are known. The computed difference can be inverted directly, providing a versatile method with very little data pre-processing requirements, which we denote as recursive difference inversion. We explain the approach in a general setting, and expand it to provide a complete framework for Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) detection using a point-dipole model. Being an extension of classic along-track gradients, the method retains many of the same properties, which include added robustness to external time-dependent disturbances, and the ability to produce aesthetic visual data representations. In addition, the framework requires neither tie lines, data levelling, nor diurnal corrections. Only light pre-processing actions, namely initial survey trimming and data position calculation, are required. The method is demonstrated on data from a dual sensor system, conventionally referred to as a vertical gradiometer, which is towed from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle. The system enables collection of high-quality magnetic data in adverse settings, and simultaneously reduces the risk of inadvertent UXO detonations. To enable qualitative testing, we established a UXO detection test facility with several buried UXO, typical to World War II, in a magnetically complex in-land area. Data from the test facility was mainly used to evaluate inversion robustness and depth accuracy of the point-dipole model. Subsequently, we apply the method to real UXO survey data collected for the Hornsea II offshore wind farm project in the United Kingdom. This data set was collected in a coastal setting, and subject to significant sensor position changes during flight due to varying wind conditions over multiple survey days. This makes the raw data set challenging to interpret directly, but it can still be easily and reliably inverted for source locations through recursive difference inversion. In each of the two data sets, we attempt to recover UXO positions using recursive difference inversion on data from both a single sensor, as well as on data from two synchronized sensors, in each case inverting the difference directly for point-dipole model parameters. To seed the inversion, we propose a simple routine for picking out potential targets, based on the choice of a significant peak prominence in the time-series of computed differences. Higher order difference inversion was found to provide robust results in the magnetically complex setting, and the recovered equivalent dipole depths were found to approximate the actual UXO depths well.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Continuing advances within unmanned aerial vehicles and scalar magnetic sensor technology are revolutionizing geophysical remote sensing. For perspective, examples of high resolution, low noise data presented in this study enabled detection and accurate positioning of human-made ferrous objects with a total mass of 0.5 kg, from altitudes around and above 2 m. However, with these new possibilities come a requirement of higher fidelity, where good sensor position estimates, in particular, are key to achieving a data quality sufficient for reliable data interpretation and geophysical inversion. Apart from inherent instrument properties, typical factors that hamper sensor position estimation are lag and parallax errors. Lag errors arise from time-stamping delays between the positioning system and sensor reading, while parallax errors stem from the imperfect recovery of sensor positions due to a decoupling and/or distancing of the positioning system and sensor head. The impact from each of these error sources is typically similar and partially or even completely inseparable. A number of correctional techniques exist, typically based on large-scale data correlations, or collection of specific additional data. We present a survey data adjustment method based on the simultaneous inversion of source parameters and a number of independent survey shifts or lags in pre-specified sections of a survey. The method is particularly suited for surveys where the sensor path through space can be assumed well known, but the sensor position itself may suffer lags or shifts relative to the position measurement. The approach is based on modelling an existing source signature within the data and requires no data transformations, such as continuation to a two-dimensional plane, or enforcing of smoothness. The approach is an amendment to independent source inversion and is ideal for scenarios where the source behaviour is thought to be well known, such as processing efforts in which the objective is source\textendash parameter inversion. In this study, we validate the approach using a simple point-dipole model to adjust synthetic data and subsequently demonstrate it on an unmanned airborne scalar magnetic survey for small unexploded ordnance targets, where a hardware malfunction resulted in unknown time-shifts between magnetic sensor readings and positioning unit output. The adjustment procedure was carried out on line data, based on a single anomaly from a 155 mm shell, and enabled the recovery of signatures from several other ferrous unexploded ordnance targets as small as 0.5 kg. Subsequent inversion on the corrected signatures provided unexploded ordnance positions with an accuracy suitable for recovery purposes.},

  abstract = {This research provides an empirical study of electrodes used to measure galvanic resistivity. The central element of this work is an estimation of errors in resistivity measurements that arise because of the type of electrode material used. Fourteen types of electrodes were tested including metal electrodes, metal-salt-compound (nonpolarizing) electrodes, and one nonmetal electrode, under conditions that are typical of those encountered during geophysical surveys. Measurement errors for resistance and chargeability were estimated using the reciprocity of data from an array of electrodes such as might be used for electric-resistance tomography. The same error analysis was applied to data from a network of high-precision resistors to separate instrument errors from electrode errors. Significant differences were observed in errors produced by different electrode materials. We conclude that the choice of electrode is very important for resistivity or chargeability surveys. Iron, steel (including rebar), lead, and phosphor bronze produced the smallest errors in resistance and chargeability. Aluminum, magnesium, titanium, copper, and zinc produced the largest errors. Stainless steel (alloy 316), tin, and brass performed reasonably well, as did carbon, which was the only nonmetal tested.},

The method is based on the detection of diffracted waves by concentrating the signal amplitudes from diffracting points on the seismic section. This is done using a correlation procedure that enhances the amplitude of the seismic signal at the location of the diffractors on the common-diffraction-point section (D-section). The new local time correction for diffraction traveltime curve parameterization is based on the radius of curvature of the diffracted wavefront and near-surface velocity. We use the idea of seismic monitoring for detection and delineating local objects which may occur within the subsurface resulting from human activity or fast geological processes. The method consists of continuous repetition of seismic experiments above an investigated area, constructing D-sections, and comparing the images obtained.},

Traditional widely used algorithms for the inversion of magnetic data can recover the distribution of the apparent susceptibility or total magnetization intensity, but do not provide information on the remanent magnetization. In this paper, we propose a framework to directly invert for the magnetic susceptibility and the natural remanent magnetization vector using surface or airborne magnetic data, assuming that the K\"oenigsberger ratio of the rock is known or approximately deducible. The susceptibility and remanence are computed using two different approaches: (1) the susceptibility, intensity, and direction of the remanent magnetization are continuously recovered for each discretized cell and (2) the remanence direction is assumed to be uniform in each subzone and is iteratively computed as discrete values. Both processes are implemented using the preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm. The method is tested on three synthetic models and one field data set from the Zaohuohexi iron-ore deposit, Qinghai Province, northwest China. The results of the continuous inversion show the trend of the remanent magnetization directions, while the discrete inversion yields more specific values. This inversion framework can determine the source bodies' geometry and position, and also provide superposed and comprehensive information on the natural remanent magnetization, which may be useful to investigate geological bodies bearing stable primary remanent magnetization.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             Simulation-based probabilistic inversions of 3-D magnetotelluric (MT) data are arguably the best option to deal with the nonlinearity and non-uniqueness of the MT problem. However, the computational cost associated with the modelling of 3-D MT data has so far precluded the community from adopting and/or pursuing full probabilistic inversions of large MT data sets. In this contribution, we present a novel and general inversion framework, driven by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, which combines (i) an efficient parallel-in-parallel structure to solve the 3-D forward problem, (ii) a reduced order technique to create fast and accurate surrogate models of the forward problem and (iii) adaptive strategies for both the MCMC algorithm and the surrogate model. In particular, and contrary to traditional implementations, the adaptation of the surrogate is integrated into the MCMC inversion. This circumvents the need of costly offline stages to build the surrogate and further increases the overall efficiency of the method. We demonstrate the feasibility and performance of our approach to invert for large-scale conductivity structures with two numerical examples using different parametrizations and dimensionalities. In both cases, we report staggering gains in computational efficiency compared to traditional MCMC implementations. Our method finally removes the main bottleneck of probabilistic inversions of 3-D MT data and opens up new opportunities for both stand-alone MT inversions and multi-observable joint inversions for the physical state of the Earth's interior.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Studies of lunar paleopoles have been used to make a variety of inferences about past episodes of true polar wander and the orientation of the ancient dynamo field. However, the large and variable uncertainties commonly reported for such studies make robust conclusions difficult. To make further progress, we used synthetic magnetic anomalies to assess a common method to estimate magnetization direction uncertainty. We find that with this method, magnetic anomalies with higher inclinations have systematically higher uncertainties than lower inclination anomalies. We call this effect inclination bias. A similar effect is found for declination, but it is weaker. We also find that this method often produces overly conservative uncertainty estimates. To avoid these effects, we use Monte Carlo methods to determine magnetization direction uncertainty. We apply our methods to five lunar magnetic anomalies with a wide range of reported magnetization directions and paleopole locations. We find that inclination bias partly explains the previously reported anomalously high and low direction uncertainties for two of these anomalies: Reiner Gamma and Airy. Our more robust uncertainties allow us to conclude that four paleopoles are located near the equator. Such low latitudes cannot be explained by true polar wander inferred from other independent datasets, such as the lunar gravity field and the polar hydrogen distribution. This in turn implies that the dynamo axis was once offset from the spin axis.           ,              Plain Language Summary             Magnetic anomalies are large-scale features ({$\sim$}1\textendash 100's of kilometers) within the crusts of planetary bodies that occur when rocks are magnetized in the presence of a past geomagnetic field. Knowing the magnetization direction informs us about how the paleo-geomagnetic field was generated, oriented, and evolved over time. However, there is no standard method of reporting the uncertainty of the best-estimate direction. We have found that for one commonly used method of estimating uncertainty, there is a difference in uncertainties depending on what direction the rock is magnetized. We recommend a different method that the community can use to report uncertainties and present examples of this method on five lunar magnetic anomalies. We show that this method removes the difference in uncertainties based on magnetization direction. With a common method of citing uncertainty, it will be easier to compare future studies with one another, facilitating more robust claims about magnetic anomalies and paleomagnetic fields. We also show that the paleomagnetic field must have been pointing near the present-day equator at some point in the Moon's history. This means that the magnetic field axis was once offset from the spin axis as determined by observations of gravity and polar hydrogen deposits.           ,              Key Points                                                                We describe a Monte Carlo method to obtain higher precision estimates of magnetization direction at crustal magnetic anomalies                                                     We find more robust evidence for near-equatorial lunar paleopoles, implying an offset between the ancient dynamo dipole axis and spin axis},

Here, we introduce an open-source, trans-dimensional Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) algorithm GeoBIPy\textemdash Geophysical Bayesian Inference in Python\textemdash for robust uncertainty analysis of time-domain or frequency-domain airborne electromagnetic (AEM) data. The McMC algorithm provides a robust assessment of geophysical parameter uncertainty using a trans-dimensional approach that lets the AEM data inform the level of model complexity necessary by allowing the number of model layers itself to be an unknown parameter. Additional components of the Bayesian algorithm allow the user to solve for parameters such as data errors or corrections to the measured instrument height above ground. Probability distributions for a user-specified number of lithologic classes are developed through posterior clustering of McMC-derived resistivity models. Estimates of geological model structural uncertainty are thus obtained through the joint probability of geophysical parameter uncertainty and the uncertainty in the definition of each class. Examples of the implementation of this algorithm are presented for both time-domain and frequency-domain AEM data acquired in Nebraska, USA.},

Following IAGA recommendations, in this work we present a candidate model for the IGRF-13, for which we have used the available               Swarm               satellite and geomagnetic observatory ground data for the last year. In order to provide the IGRF-13 candidate, we have extrapolated the Gauss coefficients of the main field and its secular variation to January 1st, 2020. In addition, we have generated a Definitive Geomagnetic Reference Field model for 2015.0 using the same modelling approach, but focussed on a 1-year time window of data centred on 2015.0. To jointly model both satellite and ground data, we have followed the classical protocols and data filters applied in geomagnetic field modelling. Novelty arrives from the application of bootstrap analysis to solve issues related to the inhomogeneity of the spatial and temporal data distributions. This new approach allows the estimation of not only the Gauss coefficients, but also their uncertainties.},

  abstract = {Clandestine tunnels, used for drug or human trafficking and tactical operations, pose a security threat worldwide and remain elusive targets for detection with geophysical methods. P-wave diffraction imaging is an increasingly common technique for detecting subsurface discontinuities that are smaller than the seismic wavelength (such as faults, pinch outs, and small voids) and has been successfully used to detect shallow tunnels. P-wave diffractions from tunnels typically have very low signal-to-noise ratios and are therefore challenging wavefield components for imaging. Mode-specific amplitude characteristics of theoretical diffractions from a shallow tunnel were evaluated using 9C seismic modeling. Results indicate that SH-wave diffraction has the largest amplitude and coherent phase characteristics along the traveltime hyperbola, making it ideal for diffraction imaging. In real data acquired over a 9.2~m deep tunnel, amplitudes of SH-wave diffractions are 20~dB greater than P-wave diffractions. The tunnel signature on the P-wave diffraction section is of low amplitude relative to the background. The SH-wave diffraction section has a high-amplitude signal focused at the horizontal location and a traveltime consistent with the tunnel location, indicating that the SH-wave may be optimal for diffraction imaging to detect shallow tunnels.},

  abstract = {In the context of science, the well-known adage "a picture is worth a thousand words" might well be "a model is worth a thousand datasets." In this manuscript we introduce the SciML software ecosystem as a tool for mixing the information of physical laws and scientific models with data-driven machine learning approaches. We describe a mathematical object, which we denote universal differential equations (UDEs), as the unifying framework connecting the ecosystem. We show how a wide variety of applications, from automatically discovering biological mechanisms to solving high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, can be phrased and efficiently handled through the UDE formalism and its tooling. We demonstrate the generality of the software tooling to handle stochasticity, delays, and implicit constraints. This funnels the wide variety of SciML applications into a core set of training mechanisms which are highly optimized, stabilized for stiff equations, and compatible with distributed parallelism and GPU accelerators.},

  abstract = {Bayesian methods can quantify the model uncertainty that is inherent in inversion of highly nonlinear geophysical problems. In this approach, a model likelihood function based on knowledge of the data noise statistics is used to sample the posterior model distribution, which conveys information on the resolvability of the model parameters. Because these distributions are multidimensional and nonlinear, we used Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for highly efficient sampling. Because a single Markov chain can become stuck in a local probability mode, we run various randomized Markov chains independently. To some extent, this problem can be mitigated by running independent Markov chains, but unless a very large number of chains are run, biased results may be obtained. We got around these limitations by running parallel, interacting Markov chains with ``annealed'' or ``tempered'' likelihoods, which enable the whole system of chains to effectively escape local probability maxima. We tested this approach using a transdimensional algorithm, where the number of model parameters as well as the parameters themselves were treated as unknowns during the inversion. This gave us a measure of uncertainty that was independent of any particular parameterization. We then subset the ensemble of inversion models to either reduce uncertainty based on a priori constraints or to examine the probability of various geologic scenarios. We demonstrated our algorithms' fast convergence to the posterior model distribution with a synthetic 1D marine controlled-source electromagnetic data example. The speed up gained from this new approach will facilitate the practical implementation of future 2D and 3D Bayesian inversions, where the cost of each forward evaluation is significantly more expensive than for the 1D case.},

The absolute value of the analytic signal is defined as the square root of the squared sum of the vertical and the two horizontal derivatives of the magnetic field. This signal exhibits maxima over magnetization contrasts, independent of the ambient magnetic field and source magnetization directions. Locations of these maxima thus determine the outlines of magnetic sources. Under the assumption that the anomalies are caused by vertical contacts, the analytic signal is used to estimate depth using a simple amplitude half-width rule. Two examples are shown of the application of the method. In the first example, the analytic signal highlights a circular feature beneath Lake Huron that has been identified as a possible impact crater. The second example illustrates the continuation of terranes across the Cabot Strait between Cape Breton and Newfoundland in eastern Canada.},

These candidates were derived from the  geomagnetic core field model, which is constrained by Swarm satellite and ground observatory data from November 2013 to August 2019. Data were selected from magnetically quiet periods, and the model parameters have been obtained using an iteratively reweighted inversion scheme approximating a robust modified Huber norm as a measure of misfit. The root mean square misfit of the  model to Swarm and observatory data is in the order of 3\textendash 5 nT for mid and low latitudes, with a maximum of 44 nT for the satellite east component data at high latitudes. The time-varying core field is described by order 6 splines and spherical harmonic coefficients up to degree and order 20. We note that the temporal variation of the core field component of the  model is strongly damped and shows a smooth secular variation that suits well for the IGRF, where secular variation is represented as constant over 5-year intervals. Further, the external field is parameterised by a slowly varying part and a more rapidly varying part controlled by magnetic activity and interplanetary magnetic field proxies. Additionally, the Euler angles of the magnetic field sensor orientation are co-estimated. A widely discussed feature of the geomagnetic field is the South Atlantic Anomaly, a zone of weak and decreasing field strength stretching from southern Africa over to South America. The IGRF and  indicate that the anomaly has developed a second, less pronounced eastern minimum at Earth's surface since 2007. We observe that while the strong western minimum continues to drift westwards, the less pronounced eastern minimum currently drifts eastward at Earth's surface. This does not seem to be linked to any eastward motion at the core\textendash mantle boundary, but rather to intensity changes of westward drifting flux patches contributing to the observed surface field. Also, we report a sudden change in the secular variation measured at two South Atlantic observatories around 2015.0, which occurred shortly after the well-known jerk of 2014.0.},

The method interpolates the data to be gridded with a surfacehaving continuous secondderivatives and minimal total squaredcurvature. The minimum-curvature surface has an analogy in elastic plate flexure and approximatesthe shape adoptedby a thin plate flexed to pass through the data points. Minimum-curvature surfaces may have large oscillations and extraneous inflection points which make them unsuitable for gridding in many of the applications where they are commonly used. These extraneous inflection points can be eliminated by addingtension to the elastic-plate flexure equation. It is straightforward to generalize minimum-curvature gridding algorithms to include a tension parameter; the same systemof equations must be solved in either case and only the relative weights of the coefficients change. Therefore, solutions under tension require no more computational effort than minimum-curvature solutions, and any algorithm which can solve the minimum-curvature equationscan solve the more general system. We give common geologicexamples where minimum-curvature gridding produces erroneous results but gridding with tension yields a good solution. We also outline how to improve the convergence of an iterative method of solution for the gridding equations.},

  abstract = {To facilitate the modeling of time-domain controlled-source electromagnetic surveys, we have developed an efficient finite-element method with weighted Laguerre polynomials, which indicates a much lower computational complexity than conventional time integration methods. Our method allows sampling the field at arbitrary time steps, and its accuracy is determined by the number of polynomials, instead of the time sampling interval. An analysis is performed regarding the optimization of the polynomial number to be used and the criterion of selecting the time scale factor. We conduct two numerical tests in marine and land survey environments to demonstrate the superiority of our method over the existing backward Euler time integration method. Our method is expected to facilitate the modeling of transient electromagnetic surveys in the geophysical regime.},

  abstract = {The transient electromagnetic (TEM) response of a wire loop at the surface of the earth has been studied in detail for several decades. When current in the loop is rapidly switched off, an identical system of current, commonly referred to as a ``smoke ring,'' is induced in the conductive subsurface and diffuses downward and outward into the earth. What has not been studied as thoroughly is the response of a loop buried within a conductive medium, as might be the case in the marine environment or when TEM prospecting systems are placed in mine tunnels or horizontal boreholes. We have examined the TEM response of a horizontal wire loop buried within a conductive half-space. Expressions were derived for the azimuthal electric field and corresponding vertical and radial magnetic fields. Our results showed that when the loop is far from the earth-air interface, a single smoke ring system diffuses radially outward from the transmitter, while the electric field and corresponding current density decays away in the vertical direction. As the loop approaches the interface, the smoke ring system diffuses radially at early times, but gradually, the complex image of the loop in the air produces a system of secondary azimuthal electric fields, which, when combined with the primary field, adds a vertical component to the field diffusion. At late times, the field behavior reduces to the well-known surface case and the maximum current system diffuses downward at a constant angle of 26\textdegree{} with respect to the plane of the loop. We concluded that it was the effect of the interface that produces the downward migration of a smoke ring system, whereas the outward migration is mainly generated by the primary field.},

  abstract = {Electromagnetic surveys using a vertical transmitter loop are common in land, marine, and airborne geophysical exploration. Most of these horizontal magnetic dipole (HMD) systems operate in the frequency domain, measuring the time derivative of the induced magnetic fields, and therefore a majority of studies have focused on this subset of field measurements. We examine the time-domain electromagnetic response of a HMD including the electric fields and corresponding smoke rings produced in a conductive half-space. Cases of a dipole at the surface and buried within the earth are considered. Results indicate that when the current in the transmitter is rapidly switched off, a single smoke ring is produced within the plane of the vertical transmitter loop, which is then distorted by the air-earth interface. In this situation, the circular smoke ring, which would normally diffuse symmetrically away from the source in a whole space, is approximately transformed into an ellipse, with a vertical major axis at an early time and a horizontal major axis at a late time. As measured from the location of the transmitter, the depth of investigation and lateral footprint of such a system increases with burial depth. It is also observed that the electric field measured in the direction of the magnetic dipole only contains a secondary response related to the charge accumulation on any horizontal conductivity boundaries because the primary field is always absent. This field component can be expressed analytically in terms of a static and time-varying field, the latter term adding spatial complexity to the total horizontal electric field at the earth surface at early times. Applications of this theoretical study include the design of time-domain induction-logging tools, crossborehole electromagnetic surveys, underground mine expansion work, mine rescue procedures, and novel marine electromagnetic experiments.},

The Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM) density parameters can be adopted as a 1-D reference density model and further refined using more detailed 2-D or 3-D crust and mantle density models. Alternatively, the AK135-F density parameters can be used for this purpose. In this study, we investigate options for a refinement of the Earth's synthetic density model by assessing the accuracy of available 1-D density models, specifically the PREM and AK135-F radial density parameters. First, we use density parameters from both models to estimate the Earth's total mass and compare these estimates with published results. We then estimate the Earth's gravity field parameters, particularly the geoidal geopotential number W0 and the mean gravitational attraction and compare them with published values. According to our results, the Earth's total mass from the two models (the PREM and the AK135-F) differ less than 0.02\% and 0.01\%, respectively, when compared with the value adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The geoidal geopotential values of the two models differ from the value adopted by the IAU by less than 0.1\% and 0.04\%, respectively. The values of the mean gravitational attraction of the two models differ less than 0.02\% and 0.08\%, respectively, when compared with the value obtained from the geocentric gravitational constant and the Earth's mean radius. These numerical findings ascertain that the PREM and AK135-F density parameters are suitable for defining a 1-D reference density model.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The crust of Mars shows strong remanent magnetization, which was likely acquired during the early phases of planetary evolution when a core dynamo still operated. The direction of the field responsible for magnetizing the crust holds clues to the working of the dynamo and the rotational dynamics of the planet. By analyzing individual crustal magnetic field anomalies and with the aid of additional assumptions, the field orientations can be reconstructed. We have implemented an Equivalent Source Dipole method to determine the main field orientation during magnetization, assuming that the considered anomalies are unidirectionally magnetized without making specific assumptions about the source geometry. The available data are fit in a least squares sense, and the method yields confidence intervals for the admissible paleopole locations. The method was applied to six crustal magnetic field anomalies, two of which require a south pole in the northern hemisphere, while three indicate a south pole in the southern hemisphere. This implies that polar reversals took place at least once in Martian history. Furthermore, one of the investigated anomalies requires a south pole at equatorial to midlatitudes, indicating that a significant amount of true polar wander must have occurred on Mars. Finally, tests with synthetic data indicate that admissible paleopole locations typically spread across at least 25\% of the planet, which may partially explain the scatter found in previously published paleopole studies.           ,              Plain Language Summary             Today, the crust of Mars is strongly magnetized, and magnetization was likely acquired when a core dynamo still operated. In this study, the crustal magnetization is investigated and inferences about the former global magnetic field are made. To this end, we have implemented a method to synthesize the local sources of crustal magnetization and determined the former main field orientation. The method was applied to six crustal magnetic field anomalies, two of which require a former magnetic south pole in the northern hemisphere, while three indicate a former magnetic south pole in the southern hemisphere. This implies that at least once in the Martian history the magnetic north and south poles switched places. Furthermore, one of the investigated anomalies requires a former magnetic south pole at equatorial to midlatitudes, indicating that the rotational axis of Mars must have altered its alignment significantly.           ,              Key Points                                                                We use an Equivalent Source Dipole method to investigate six Martian crustal magnetic field anomalies                                                     Results indicate that at least one polar reversal event must have occurred on Mars                                                     Mars must have furthermore experienced significant true polar wander},

  abstract = {Global optimization and stochastic approaches to the interpretation of measured data have recently gained particular attraction as tools for directed search for and/or verification of characteristic structural details and quantitative parameters of the deep structure, which is a task often arising when interpreting geoelectrical induction data in seismoactive and volcanic areas. We present a comparison of three common global optimization and stochastic approaches to the solution of a magnetotelluric inverse problem for thick layer structures, specifically the controlled random search algorithm, the stochastic sampling by the Monte Carlo method with Markov chains and its newly suggested approximate, but largely accelerated, version, the neighbourhood algorithm. We test the algorithms on a notoriously difficult synthetic 5-layer structure with two conductors situated at different depths, as well as on the experimental COPROD1 data set standardly used to benchmark 1D magnetotelluric inversion codes. The controlled random search algorithm is a fast and reliable global minimization procedure if a relatively small number of parameters is involved and a search for a single target minimum is the main objective of the inversion. By repeated runs with different starting test model pools, a sufficiently exhaustive mapping of the parameter space can be accomplished. The Markov chain Monte Carlo gives the most complete information for the parameter estimation and their uncertainty assessment by providing samples from the posterior probability distribution of the model parameters conditioned on the experimental data. Though computationally intensive, this method shows good performance provided the model parameters are sufficiently decorrelated. For layered models with mixed resistivities and layer thicknesses, where strong correlations occur and even different model classes may conform to the target function, the method often converges poorly and even very long chains do not guarantee fair distributions of the model parameters according to their probability densities. The neighbourhood resampling procedure attempts to accelerate the Monte Carlo simulation by approximating the computationally expensive true target function by a simpler, piecewise constant interpolant on a Voronoi mesh constructed over a set of pre-generated models. The method performs relatively fast but seems to suggest systematically larger uncertainties for the model parameters. The results of the stochastic simulations are compared with the standard linearized solutions both for thick layer models and for smooth Occam solutions.},

In this paper, we propose a new deep learning algorithm for processing the 3-D reconstruction of ERT. This approach relies on the approximation of the inverse operator considered as a nonlinear function linking the section of apparent resistivity as input and the underground distribution of electrical resistivity as output. This approximation is performed with a large amount of known data to obtain an accurate generalization of the inverse operator by identifying during the learning process a set of parameters assigned to the neural networks. To train the network, the subsurface resistivity models are theoretically generated by a geostatistical anisotropic Gaussian generator, and their corresponding apparent resistivity by solving numerically 3-D Poisson's equation. These data are formed in a way to have the same size and trained on the convolutional neural networks with SegNet architecture containing a three-level encoder and decoder network ending with a regression layer. The encoders including the convolutional, max-pooling and nonlinear activation operations are sequentially performed to extract the main features of input data in lower resolution maps. On the other side, the decoders are dedicated to upsampling operations in concatenating with feature maps transferred from encoders to compensate the loss of resolution. The tool has been successfully validated on different synthetic cases and with particular attention to how data quality in terms of resolution and noise affects the effectiveness of the approach.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             A test site containing 24 targets of various disarmed unexploded ordnance (UXO) and non-UXO items were placed on a beach on the island of R\o m\o{} (Denmark) in a 600~m \texttimes{} 100~m area. Scalar magnetic anomalies were measured at 3\textendash 5~m altitude using an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV), towing a bird with a three-sensor triangular configuration to achieve a dense coverage with flight lines of 2~m spacing. The triple-sensor data set is utilized in a probabilistic inversion setup to infer the magnetic moments of the 24 targets. The purpose of the study, is to try and distinguish between different types of ferromagnetic objects (UXO, non-UXO) using magnetic anomaly data. The inversion methodology uses different forward models (prolate spheroids, rectangular prisms) to infer target shape, size and orientation in an attempt to discriminate between UXO and non-UXO items. Stochastic inversions are carried out using different prior assumptions of remanent magnetization strength (10, 50 and 80~per~cent) of the induced dipole moment. Among the three levels of remanent magnetization strength in the prior, only some cases of discrimination seem evident for the lowest strength of remanence. One item is correctly classified as a true-negative (i.e. non-UXO) when assuming low remanent magnetization strength (10~per~cent of the induced moment). However, at low remanent strength, one false-negative classification emerges, making any discrimination unreliable when assuming such low remanent magnetization. In addition to the discrimination study, different covariance models are utilized to optimize the inversion by addressing correlated errors and noise in the triple-sensor data set. Three covariance models are tested to try and account for spatially correlated noise and potential errors among the three sensors of each overflight. In many cases, the covariance models presented show a potential increase in sampling efficiency and consistency between data and the noise model, suggesting a more robust approach to a noise model in magnetic anomaly inversions. If the noise model is poor, however, it may bias the results by addressing the anomaly signal as noise. The inversions with correlated noise models are compared with inversions using a simple uncorrelated noise model. For several cases of data anomalies, differences between the inversion estimates when using correlated and uncorrelated noise models were evident, indicating that some bias may appear when assuming uncorrelated noise. Due to the general high presence of correlated signals in magnetic survey data, correlated noise models can significantly improve the overall uncertainty estimate of the estimated dipole moment. The study demonstrates, in terms of the 24 targets considered, that discrimination between UXO and non-UXO using magnetics is difficult. However, when using scalar magnetic data of high quality and resolution, the estimated dipole moments are often well resolved and uniquely defined in magnitude and position. This could provide valuable posterior information for future inversion studies by building a library of inferred magnetic moments from targets that have been found and inspected.},

  abstract = {SUMMARY             We investigate if it is theoretically possible to discriminate between unexploded ordnance (UXO) and non-UXO sources by modelling the magnetic dipole moment for ferrous objects of different shapes and sizes. This is carried out by approximating the volumetric demagnetization factors of rectangular prisms, representing shapes similar to a long rod or flat steel plate. By modelling different UXO as prolate spheroids the demagnetization factors can be determined which can be compared with the magnetic response of a prism. The inversion is carried out in a probabilistic framework, where the UXO forward model and the non-UXO forward model are assigned individual prior models in terms of shape, size, orientation and remanent magnetization of the object. 95 independent realizations of the prism prior model are generated to make 95 synthetic anomalies exemplifying non-UXO objects, which are inverted for using the UXO model. It is investigated if an identical magnetic moment can be produced between the two models and how well resolved the magnetic moment is in terms of the measured anomaly. The case study is carried out in two steps where we first have little prior information of expected UXO properties and another where a UXO prior is introduced with expected values of aspect ratio and size of 24 different UXO, that are often encountered in the North Sea. With no prior information of expected UXO, discrimination is at many times implausible, unless elongated rod prism objects are considered, where the magnetic moment often can not be reproduced by a spheroid. Introducing the UXO prior we achieve a much better discrimination rate when using the list of expected UXO properties. By using the UXO prior we can account for a much higher remanent magnetization allowed in the prior, and still achieve high discrimination capabilities in comparison to a case with no UXO prior.},

However, for highly magnetic sources, the approximation error of [Formula: see text] cannot be ignored. To reduce the error, we have developed a method for calculating [Formula: see text] by using airborne vector magnetic data based on the vector relationship of geomagnetic field [Formula: see text]. The calculation uses the magnitude of the vectors [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] through a simple approach. To ensure that each magnitude has the same level, we normalize the magnitude of [Formula: see text] using the total-field magnetic data measured by the scalar magnetic sensor. The method is applied to the measured airborne vector magnetic data at the Qixin area of the East Tianshan Mountains in China. The results indicate that the calculated [Formula: see text] has high precision and can distinguish the approximation error of approximately 0.1~nT. We also analyze the characteristics of the approximation error that are caused by the effects of different total magnetization inclinations. These error characteristics are used to predict the total magnetization inclination of a 2D magnetic source based on the measured airborne vector magnetic data.},

With only a single seismic station, the determination of the epicentral location is far more challenging than on the Earth. The Marsquake Service (MQS) produces seismicity catalogs from data collected by InSight, and provides distance and back azimuth estimates when these can be reliably determined; when both are available, these are combined to provide a location. Currently, MQS does not assign a back azimuth to the vast majority of marsquakes. In this work we develop and apply a polarization analysis method to determine the back azimuth of seismic events from the polarization of observed P- and S-wave arrivals. The method is first applied to synthetic marsquakes and then calibrated using a set of well-located earthquakes that have been recorded in Tennant Creek, Australia. We find that the back azimuth is estimated reliably using our polarization method. The same approach is then used for a set of high-quality marsquakes recorded up to October 2021. We are able to estimate back azimuths for 24 marsquakes, 16 of these without MQS back azimuths. We locate most events to the east of InSight, in the general region of Cerberus Fossae.},

  abstract = {Over several decades, much research has been done to develop 3D electromagnetic inversion algorithms. Due to the computational complexity and the memory requirements for 3D time-domain electromagnetic (TEM) inversion algorithms, many real-world surveys are inverted within one dimension. To speed up calculations and manage memory for 3D inversions of TEM data, we have developed an approach using three uncoupled meshes: an inversion mesh, a forward-model mesh, and a mesh for Jacobian calculations. The inversion mesh is a coarse regular and structured mesh, such that constraints are easily enforced between the model parameters. Forward responses are calculated on a dense unstructured mesh to obtain accurate electromagnetic fields, whereas the Jacobian is calculated on a coarse unstructured mesh. We found that using a coarse mesh for the Jacobian is sufficient for the inversion to converge and, equally important, that it provides a significant speed boost in the overall inversion process, compared to calculating it on the forward-modeling mesh. The unstructured meshes are made of tetrahedral elements, and the electromagnetic fields are calculated using the finite-element method. The inversion optimization uses a standard Gauss-Newton formulation. For further speed up and memory optimizing of the inversion, we use domain decomposition for calculating the responses for each transmitter separately and parallelize the problem over domains using OpenMP. Compared to a 1D solution, the accuracy for the Jacobian is 1\%\textendash 5\% for the dense mesh and 2\%\textendash 7\% for the coarse mesh, but the calculation time is approximately five times faster for the coarse mesh. We also examined the algorithm on a small ground-based TEM data set acquired in an area where a 3D earth distorts the electromagnetic fields to such a degree that a 1D inversion is not feasible.},

This work has developed a mechanism for defining LIs systematically for different types of density functions. Two-dimensional vector gravity potential is defined as a vector, the net circulation of which, along the closed contour bounding a 2D mass, equals the gravity anomaly caused by the 2D mass. Two representative types of LIs are defined: an LI with an arctangent kernel for any depth-dependent density-contrast function, which has been studied historically; and an LI with a simple algebraic kernel for any integrable density-contrast function. The present work offers (1) a vectorial-based derivation of formulas that do not suffer from the arbitrary sign conventions found in some historical approaches; and (2) a simple algebraic kernel in line integrals as an alternative to the historical arctangent kernel, with the possibility of extension to more general cases. The concept of 2D vector gravity potential provides a useful tool for defining LIs systematically for any mass density function, helping us understand how dimensions can be reduced in a calculating gravity anomaly, especially when the density contrast varies with space. LIs have been tested in case studies. The maximum differences in calculated gravity anomalies by different LIs for the case studies were between [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text]. Processing time required per station per segment of the 2D polygon of a 2D mass using LIs is [Formula: see text] on a Dell Optiplex GX 620 desktop computer, almost independent of the density function. The results indicate that the two types of LIs provide very fast, efficient, and reliable algorithms in gravity modeling or inversion for various types of density-contrast functions.},

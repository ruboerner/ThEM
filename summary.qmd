What were the most important insights?

-   Understanding of Maxwell's equations
-   Derivation of the curl-curl equation of electromagnetics
-   Dipole sources
-   Incremental modifications of the underlying model: From uniform full-space to layered half-space
-   Understanding time-domain induction
-   Implementation of Hankel integrals
-   Excurse to 2D and 3D modelling applications

Why is the lecture on the *Theory of EM* important?

-   All EM geophysics - from magnetotellurics (MT) to controlled-source EM (CSEM) - relies on solving Maxwell's equations under specific boundary conditions

-   Knowing how fields decay, diffuse, or reflect allows for optimal sensor placement, source design, and noise mitigation

-   Understanding the theory is essential for developing accurate forward solvers and stable, regularized inverse algorithms

-   Time-domain EM, airborne EM, and marine EM all evolved from theoretical insights
